## C4 Model

__C4 model__ is a framework for visualizing the architecture of a software system. It was created by Simon Brown and is designed to be a simple way to communicate and document software architecture. The "C4" stands for "Context, Containers, Components, and Code" which represent different levels of abstraction in the architecture.

### Context Diagram (C1)

Describes the high-level view of the system, showing how it interacts with external entities such as users, systems, or external services.

### Container Diagram (C2)

Focuses on the containers within the system, representing the applications or services and their dependencies. It provides a high-level view of the software architecture.

### Component Diagram (C3)

Dives deeper into the internal components or classes of a container, illustrating the key components and their interactions.

### Code Diagram (C4)

Represents the actual code, providing a detailed view of the classes, methods, and relationships within a specific component.
