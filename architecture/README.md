# Architecture

## What is architecture?

Software architecture is about making fundamental structural choices which are costly to change once implemented.

Architecture Definition

## Architecture Definition

Software architecture consists of:

* Structure
* Architecture characteristics
  * Availability, Reliability, Testability, Scalability, Security, Agility, Fault tolerance, Elasticity, Recoverability, Performace, Deployability, Learnability
* Architecture decisions
  * [Architecture Decision Records - ADR - README.md](ADR/README.md)
* Design principles

## Expectations of Architect

There are core expectations placed on a software architect, irrespective of any given role, title, or job description:

* Make architecture decisions
* Continually analyze the architecture
* Keep current with the latest trends
* Ensure compliance with decisions
* Have business domain knowledge
* Diverse exposure and experience
* Possess interpersonal skills
* Understand and navigate politics

## Application Architecture Goals

* Managing complexity (reducing accidental complexity)
* Application maintainability
* Accidental complexity vs evolvability
* Knowledge communication
* Managing obsolescence
* Reusability
* Development speed up

# Architecture vs. Design

Architecture is the __logical__ implementation of the system.

Design is the __physical__ implementation of the system.

# Laws of Software Architecture

## First Law

__Everything in software architecture is a trade-off.__

## Second Law

___Why_ is more important than _how_.__
