# Architecture Decision Records

**Architecture Decision Record (ADR)** is a document that captures decisions made regarding the design and architecture of a
software system. ADRs are used to document the context, options considered, and rationale behind architectural decisions. They
serve as a valuable resource for both current and future development teams to understand the reasoning behind certain design
choices.

## ADR typically includes the following information

* __Title__ - A concise description of the decision.
* __Status__ - Indicates the current status of the decision, such as proposed, accepted, rejected, etc.
* __Context__ - The factors and conditions influencing the decision.
* __Decision__ - The chosen option or solution.
* __Consequences__ - The potential impact and implications of the decision.
* __Compliance__ - How the architecture decision will be measured and governed from a compliance perspective.
* __Notes__ - This section includes various metadata about the ADR (Author, Approval Date, Modified By, etc.)
