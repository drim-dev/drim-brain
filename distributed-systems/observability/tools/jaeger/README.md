# Jaeger


Jaeger is an open-source, end-to-end distributed tracing system that helps developers monitor and troubleshoot complex microservices-based architectures. Distributed tracing involves tracking requests as they traverse various services in a system, allowing developers to gain insights into the performance and behavior of these services.

Key features of Jaeger include:

1. __Trace Collection__: Jaeger collects traces, which represent the journey of a request as it moves through various components of a distributed system. Each trace consists of a series of spans, where each span represents an operation within a service.

2. __Storage__: Jaeger stores trace data, making it available for analysis and visualization. The system supports multiple storage backends, including Elasticsearch, Cassandra, and others.

3. __Query and Visualization__: Jaeger provides a web-based user interface that allows users to query and visualize trace data. Developers can explore traces, view timelines, identify performance bottlenecks, and troubleshoot issues in a distributed environment.

4. __OpenTelemetry Compatibility__: Jaeger is compatible with the OpenTelemetry standard, which is an open, vendor-neutral API for distributed tracing. This compatibility allows developers to use Jaeger with applications that adhere to the OpenTelemetry specification.

Community and Ecosystem: Jaeger has an active and growing community. It is part of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), and its adoption has increased with the rise of microservices architectures.
