# Prometheus

Prometheus is an open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit designed for reliability and scalability in modern, dynamic environments. It is part of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) and is widely used for monitoring containerized applications, microservices architectures, and other cloud-native technologies. Prometheus focuses on providing a time-series-based approach to monitoring, collecting and storing metrics, and triggering alerts based on predefined conditions.

Key features of Prometheus include:

1. __Time-Series Data Collection__: Prometheus collects time-series data, typically in the form of numerical metrics representing the state of a system over time. It can scrape metrics from various sources, including applications, services, and infrastructure components.

2. __Multi-Dimensional Data Model__: Prometheus uses a multi-dimensional data model to organize and identify metrics. Each metric is associated with a set of key-value pairs called labels, allowing for efficient querying and filtering of data.

3. __Scalable and Pull-Based Architecture__: Prometheus uses a pull-based model, where it periodically scrapes metrics from configured targets. This architecture is designed to be scalable and allows Prometheus to collect metrics from a large number of targets.

4. __Query Language (PromQL)__: Prometheus provides a powerful query language called PromQL that allows users to perform complex queries and aggregations on the collected metrics. PromQL enables users to create custom dashboards and alerts.

5. __Alerting__: Prometheus includes a built-in alerting system that allows users to define alert rules based on the metrics collected. When a rule is triggered, Prometheus can send alerts to various alerting channels, such as email, Slack, or other notification systems.

6. __Service Discovery__: Prometheus supports service discovery mechanisms, making it well-suited for dynamic and cloud-native environments. It can automatically discover and monitor new instances of services as they are deployed.

7. __Integration with Grafana__: While Prometheus provides its own basic web-based UI, it is often used in conjunction with visualization tools like Grafana. Grafana can connect to Prometheus as a data source, providing a more feature-rich environment for creating dashboards and exploring metrics.

8. __Extensibility__: Prometheus is extensible and has a growing ecosystem of exporters and integrations. Exporters are components that collect and expose metrics from third-party systems, allowing Prometheus to scrape and monitor a wide range of technologies.
