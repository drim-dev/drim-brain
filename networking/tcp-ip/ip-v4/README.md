# IPv4

The __Internet Protocol__ (__IP__) is the network layer communications protocol in the Internet protocol suite for relaying _datagrams_ across network boundaries. Its routing function enables _internetworking_, and essentially establishes the Internet.

The first major version of IP, Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4), is the dominant protocol of the Internet. Its successor is Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6), which has been in increasing deployment on the public Internet since around 2006.

The Internet Protocol is responsible for:

1. Addressing host interfaces
2. Encapsulating data into datagrams (including fragmentation and reassembly)
3. Routing datagrams from a source host interface to a destination host interface across one or more IP networks.

For these purposes, the Internet Protocol defines the format of packets and provides an addressing system.
